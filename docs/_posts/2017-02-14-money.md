The amount of money left on your fellowship pot is available On ["My Dashboard"]({{site.demo_site}}/dashboard/).

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/claimant-dashboard.png){: .img-responsive}

"Grant" means your initial fellowship grant,
"Available" means your fellowship grant not committed or spent,
"Committed" means the sum of approved funding requests' budget,
and "Spent" means the sum of all approved expenses claim.
If you sum "Available", "Committed" and "Spent" **during your inaugural year**
it should be equal to "Grant".
After your inaugural year,
"Available" will be Â£0 but you still can make a funding request.

Some funding requests and expenses,
e.g. related with Fellows face to face selection meeting, Fellows inaugural meeting and Collaborations Workshop,
will not be summed when computing "Available", "Committed" and "Spent".

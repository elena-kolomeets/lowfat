The amount of money left on your fellowship pot is available On ["My Dashboard"]({{site.demo_site}}/dashboard/).

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/claimant-dashboard.png){: .img-responsive}

"Grant" means your initial fellowship grant,
"Available" means your fellowship grant not committed or spent,
"Committed" means the sum of approved funding requests' budget,
and "Spent" means the sum of all approved expenses claim.
If you sum "Available", "Committed" and "Spent" **during your inaugural year**
it should be equal to "Grant".
After your inaugural year,
"Available" will be £0 but you still can make a funding request.

Some funding requests and expenses,
e.g. related with Fellows face to face selection meeting, Fellows inaugural meeting and Collaborations Workshop,
will not be summed when computing "Available", "Committed" and "Spent".

## Example

At the begin of the fellowship,
Fellow has £3000 available.

<div class="money-bar-graph">
  <span style="width:100%" class="money-available">£3000</span>
</div>
</figure>

When a funding request of £750 is submitted,
£750 is reserved.

<div class="money-bar-graph">
  <span style="width:25%" class="money-reserved">£750</span>
  <span style="width:75%" class="money-available">$2250</span>
</div>
</figure>

If the funding request is deleted by the user
or denied by the administrator,
the £750 return to the available portion of the grant.
If the funding request is approved,
the £750 stay reserved until the funding request is archived.

When the fellow submit a expense of £600
and it is processed,
the £600 is marked as used.
And £150 stay as reserved.

</div>

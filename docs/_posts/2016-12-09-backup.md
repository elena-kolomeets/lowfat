We use [django-dbbackup](http://django-dbbackup.readthedocs.io/)
for backup of the data. To create a new backup, run

~~~
$ python3 manage.py dbbackup && python3 manage.py mediabackup
~~~

The backup files will be created in `backups`. To restore the last backup, run

~~~
$ python3 manage.py dbrestore && python3 manage.py mediarestore
~~~

**You should copy the backup files to another machine.** You can accomplish this using [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell), ... For Google Drive you can use [Petter Rasmussen's Google Drive CLI Client](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive).
